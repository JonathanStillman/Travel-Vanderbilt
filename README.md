# Description

This website allows users to search for a city and loads top-rated restaurants from the Yelp API. The name, star rating, and phone number of each restaurant is added to the page along with an image from the Yelp profile and a link to the restaurant's Yelp listing. 

The Algolia Places API autofills city names to help users search.
